# Command Group

_Extension to [`Command`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html) to spawn in a process group._

- **[API documentation][docs]**.
- [Dual-licensed][copyright] with Apache 2.0 and MIT.
- Minimum Supported Rust Version: 1.68.0.
  - Only the last five stable versions are supported.
  - MSRV increases within that range at publish time will not incur major version bumps.
- Soft-launch: the successor of command-group is [process-wrap](https://github.com/watchexec/process-wrap). No further work will be done on command-group.

## Quick start

```toml
[dependencies]
command-group = "5.0.1"
```

```rust
use std::process::Command;
use command_group::CommandGroup;

let mut child = Command::new("watch").arg("ls").group_spawn()?;
let status = child.wait()?;
dbg!(status);
```

### Async: Tokio

```toml
[dependencies]
command-group = { version = "5.0.1", features = ["with-tokio"] }
tokio = { version = "1.10.0", features = ["full"] }
```

```rust
use tokio::process::Command;
use command_group::AsyncCommandGroup;

let mut child = Command::new("watch").arg("ls").group_spawn()?;
let status = child.wait().await?;
dbg!(status);
```
